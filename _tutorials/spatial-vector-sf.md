## 1. Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of working with geospatial
vector data in R. This tutorial is recommended for learners who have
some beginner experience with R and the **tidyverse** (mainly **dplyr**,
**ggplot2** and **magrittr pipes (%&gt;%)**).

If you are not familiar with some of these, here are some introductory
tutorials:

-   [Intro to R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/)
-   [Basic data
    manipulation](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-manip-intro/)
-   [Efficient data
    manipulation](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-manip-efficient/)
-   [Beautiful and informative data
    visalisation](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/datavis/)

**This tutorial does not require downloading any files.** Only an
installation of R 4.0+ and the necessary libraries will be needed, as
all spatial data we will use will be downloaded directly in the R
session.

**We highly recommend installing the newest version of R and updating
all of the libraries.** You check your R version by running the command
`sessionInfo()`. You can easily update all of your libraries from
RStudio by going to the “Packages” tab (on the lower-right panel), and
clicking on “Update,” then “Select All” and “Install Updates.”

We will use vector data from
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM): a freely
accessible, open data online map service. We will use R to obtain
certain features we would like to work with: in this tutorial, green
spaces in [Edinburgh,
Scotland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/55.9400/-3.2100). (Data
from the query also provided as file in case the query doesn’t work, see
the [OSM query](#osm-query) section.)

We will use the data we get to calculate the area covered by each park
and create static and interactive maps, where each type of greenspace is
coloured in a different custom colour. We will demonstrate how to
transform the data into a different coordinate reference system and how
to perform other spatial operations (union and difference between
polygons).

The text **output of some code chunks is included** just under the code chunk, with lines starting with "##".


#### What are geospatial vector data?

Geospatial **vector** data consist of geometries defined based on
geographic coordinates. Here are some examples of [different geometry
types](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html#simple-feature-geometry-types):
-   The simplest example is a *point* geometry, which represents a
    single point on the Earth’s surface. The locations of different
    buildings, offices, venues, etc in a city usually take that form.
-   A more complex geometry is a *linestring*, consisting of multiple
    points connected with each other. Roads, rivers and railways can be
    represented by linestrings.
-   If multiple points are connected to each other to form an enclosed
    shape, that is a *polygon*. Any area can be represented by a spatial
    polygon - a lake, a golf course, or the border of a country.
-   There are also *multi-* geometries for each of the three listed
    types, consisting of multiple sets of that particular feature. For
    example, a *multipolygon* can consist of more than one separate
    polygon, useful when we want to represent a non-contiguous area.

This is to be contrasted with **raster** data, which constist of a
matrix of cells (i.e. pixels). An example of raster geographic data is
remote sensing imagery. Many maps come in the form of raster images:
they do not contain the coordinates of all of the features as they are
composed of pixels, and may therefore look pixelated if the resolution
is not high enough. However, they usually take less space than vector
maps, and can be a faster and more useful map background when the
resolution is good. If you are interested rasters, you can read more
about the difference between rasters and vectors
[here](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#raster-data),
and follow [this
tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/spatial/) to learn
how to work with raster data in R.


#### The *sf* library

**Simple features** is a set of standards for geospatial data. The
**sf** library is an implementation of simple features in R.

An `sf` object in R is based on the `dataframe`: it has multiple columns
with different variables (often called attributes), as well as a
geometry column, containing the spatial vector geometry. Each row
represents one feature. It also contains information about the
coordinate reference system used for the geometries: more on that later.

For a more detailed overview of geographic data in R and the **sf**
library check out [Chapter 2 of Geocomputation with
R.](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#spatial-class).


#### Load the R libraries

Let’s load the libraries we need.

``` r
# If you don't have any of these, install using:
# install.packages("library_name")

# Load libraries
library(dplyr) # data wrangling
library(tidyr) # data wrangling
library(ggplot2) # data visualisation
library(sf) # simple features - geospatial geometries
library(osmdata) # obtaining OpenStreetMap vector data
library(units) # working with units
library(mapview) # interactive geometry viewing
library(ggmap) # downloading raster maps from a variety of sources
library(ggspatial) # map backgrounds and annotations for ggplot
library(tmap) # static/interactive map library with ggplot-like syntax
```


Installing the **sf** library on Windows and Mac OS X should work by
running `install.packages("sf")`. If you use Linux, or have trouble
installing it, [see this
page](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#installing).

**You may get a prompt from R asking whether it should install packages
from source**. Installing from source rather than binary takes more
time, but may give you a slightly newer version. You do not usually need
to worry about this and can just respond with “no.”

## 2. OpenStreetMap query

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) provides maps of
the world mostly created by volunteers. They are completely free to
browse and use, with attribution to [© OpenStreetMap
contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) and adherence to
the [ODbL license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) required,
and are used by many public and private organisations. OSM data can be
downloaded in vector format and used for our own purposes. In this
tutorial, we will obtain data from OSM using a query. **A query is a
request for data from a database.** The **Overpass API** can be used to
perform queries written in the **overpass** query language, but simple
queries can be performed more easily using the **osmdata** library for
R, which automatically constructs the query and imports the data in a
convenient format. For this tutorial, we will extract data for the the
main types of green spaces in Edinburgh, Scotland: parks, nature
reserves, and golf courses.


#### OSM feature key-value pairs

OpenStreetMap features have attributes in key-value pairs. We can use
them to download the specific data we need. These features can easily be
explored in the web browser, by using the ‘Query features’ button:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/spatial-vector-sf/osm-online-features.gif)

As we can see here, this park has a “name” key with value “The Meadows”
and a “leisure” key with the value “park.” If we do further exploration,
we see that almost all green spaces in this city have “leisure” equal to
either “park,” “nature\_reserve,” or “golf\_course.” We will request the
data for these.


#### OSM query

First, we start by obtaining the bounding box and polygon for Edinburgh
using the `getbb()` function from the `osmdata` library.

``` r
# Get the polygon for Edinburgh
city_polygon <- getbb("City of Edinburgh",
                      featuretype = "settlement",
                      format_out = "polygon")

# Get the rectangular bounding box
city_rect <- getbb("City of Edinburgh", featuretype = "settlement")
```

Now, we construct and execute our query:

``` r
# Get the data from OSM (might take a few seconds)
greensp_osm <-
  opq(bbox = city_polygon) %>%  # start query, input bounding box
  add_osm_feature(key = "leisure",
                  value = c("park", "nature_reserve", "golf_course")) %>%
  # we want to extract "leisure" features that are park, nature reserve or a golf course
  osmdata_sf() %>%
  # query OSM and return as simple features (sf)
  trim_osmdata(city_polygon)
  # limit data to the Edinburgh polygon instead of the rectangular bounding box
```

This is a very simple query. We will not go into more details
here, but you can read more about **osmdata**
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata#usage), and more about more
complex overpass queries (that can also easily be executed in R)
[here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_API_by_Example).

Let’s have a look at the result of our query.

``` r
# Look at query output
greensp_osm
```

The query returns a list which contains multiple sf object, each
for a different geometry type. (We can call individual elements of a
list by using `list_object$element` or `list_object[["element"]]`). In
our results, the polygons and multipolygons are likely of interest.
Let’s have a glimpse:

``` r
# In our results, polygons and multipolygons are likely of interest. Let's have a look
glimpse(greensp_osm$osm_polygons)
glimpse(greensp_osm$osm_multipolygons)
```

Here, we see that many columns have been returned, corresponding to all
attributes that at least one of the features has. The ‘geometry’ column
at the end contains the vector geometries.

Let’s extract them into one `sf` object. As we have both `POLYGON` and
`MULTIPOLYGON` features, it would be easiest to convert the `POLYGON`
features to `MULTIPOLYGON` and then bind the two `sf` objects. (Polygons
can easily be converted to multipolygons without change, while
multipolygons may have to be split into multiple features to become
polygons.)

We will use the `st_cast()` to convert the polygon feature to
multipolygons, and then `bind_rows()` to merge them into one `sf`
object. Then, we will use the `select()` function just like on regular
dataframes to keep only columns we need. We will keep the names of the
features, their OSM id (in case we would like to refer to them later),
and leisure (the type of green space).

``` r
# Convert POLYGON to MULTIPOLYGON and bind into one sf object.
greensp_sf <- bind_rows(st_cast(greensp_osm$osm_polygons, "MULTIPOLYGON"),
                                  greensp_osm$osm_multipolygons) %>%
  select(name, osm_id, leisure)
```

You may notice that we did not put the geometry column into
select. That is because in `sf` features that is not necessary: the
`select()` operation ignores it and so this column is always kept.

{% capture reveal %}

Data from OSM can change, therefore, the `sf` object as produced when
the tutorial was created is provided here. You can download the file,
load it into R, and continue with the tutorial. This is only recommended
if the query did not work, or the data somehow doesn’t work with the
rest of the tutorial.

1.  Download the .rds file <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-spatial-vector-sf">from this repository</a>. You can download by clicking on Code -> Download ZIP, then unzipping the archive.
2.  Move the `greensp_sf.rds` file into your working directory.
3.  Load the file in R: `greensp_sf <- readRDS("greensp_sf.rds")`
4.  Continue with the tutorial.

{% endcapture %}
{% include reveal.html button="Optional dataset download" content=reveal %}


Let’s explore the result. First, we can very easily plot the geometries
coloured by one of the attributes. In our case, we will use “leisure”.

``` r
# Plot coloured by the value of leisure
plot(greensp_sf["leisure"])
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/spatial-vector-sf/plot_query_sf-1.png)
<br />

The green spaces in this plot look like the [green spaces in Edinburgh
on the OSM
website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/55.9400/-3.2100), showing
us that the query has been successful.

Let’s look at the object.

``` r
head(greensp_sf)
```
```
    ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 3 fields
    ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
    ## Dimension:     XY
    ## Bounding box:  xmin: -3.388398 ymin: 55.90319 xmax: -3.140106 ymax: 55.98513
    ## Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84
    ##                           name  osm_id     leisure                       geometry
    ## 4271400            Dundas Park 4271400        park MULTIPOLYGON (((-3.387083 5...
    ## 4288119     Harrison Park East 4288119        park MULTIPOLYGON (((-3.224193 5...
    ## 4348244      Bruntsfield Links 4348244        park MULTIPOLYGON (((-3.203498 5...
    ## 4891768   Baberton Golf Course 4891768 golf_course MULTIPOLYGON (((-3.28719 55...
    ## 4891786 Kingsknowe Golf Course 4891786 golf_course MULTIPOLYGON (((-3.265052 5...
    ## 4892551                   <NA> 4892551        <NA> MULTIPOLYGON (((-3.146338 5...
```

Here, we can see the type of geometry of this sf object
(`MULTIPOLYGON`), the coordinate reference system (WGS 84 - more on that
in the next section!), and some of the values of each of the columns,
including the geometry column. Let’s see the unique values of “leisure”:

``` r
unique(greensp_sf$leisure)
```

    ## [1] "park"           "golf_course"    NA               "nature_reserve"

The query has returned the three green space types we requested, and for
some reason some NA values for “leisure.” Let’s remove these from the
object, and rename `leisure` to `greensp_type`.

``` r
# Filter out unneeded shapes
greensp_sf <-
  greensp_sf %>%
  filter(is.na(leisure) == FALSE) %>%  
  # remove leisure NAs
  rename(greensp_type = leisure) %>%
  # rename leisure to greensp_type
  st_make_valid()
  # a good function to use after importing data to make sure shapes are valid
```

We have now tidied up our dataset. Here is how we can save it as a file.


#### Save / load spatial data from file

`sf` objects can be saved in the form of spatial vector files easily
using the
[`st_write()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_write.html)
function. It supports multiple geographic data formats. Here’s how it
can be saved as a **GeoPackage (.gpkg)** format, which wraps everything
into one file (some formats, such as **.shp**, create multiple files
that need to be kept together). If the file type allows for multiple
layers, and we need to specify which layer we want to write our features
to.

You can read more about importing/exporting geographic data and
different formats in [Chapter 7 of Geocomputation with
R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html#file-formats)

``` r
st_write(greensp_sf,
         dsn = "greenspaces_Edi_OSM.gpkg", # file path
         layer="greenspaces", # layer name
         layer_options = c(paste0("DESCRIPTION=Contains spatial multipolygons for parks, ",
                                  "nature reserves and golf courses in Edinburgh, Scotland. ",
                                  "Copyright OpenStreetMap constibutors. ODbL ",
                                  "https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright")),
         # add layer description
         delete_dsn = TRUE
         # to delete the whole file first, because sometimes, we can just
         # overwrite or append one layer to an already existing file.
         # If the file doesn't exist, this will return a friendly warning.
         )
```


Reading a file is even easier, using `st_read()`:

``` r
# If we want to load this dataset:
greensp_sf <- st_read(dsn = "greenspaces_Edi_OSM.gpkg", layer="greenspaces")
```
<br />
## 3. Coordinate reference systems (CRS)

**Coordinate reference systems** relate vector geometries to the Earth’s
surface, and using the right CRS can be very important to execute our
operations successfully. There are two main types of CRS: **geographic**
and **projected**.

Geographic CRSs identify locations on the Earth using latitude and
longitude, in degree units. The surface of the Earth is represented by a
sphere or an ellipsoid.

Projected CRSs treat the Earth as a two-dimensional flat surface. All
projected CRSs are based on an underlying geographic CRS, as we will see
in a bit. The units in a projected CRS are linear, often metres.
Projection onto a 2D-surface always introduces some kind of distortion,
and the projected CRS we choose can be important depending on our goal.

If you are unfamiliar with projections, [this YouTube
video](https://youtu.be/NAzy4S4EOwc) illustrates the problem of
geographic projection and shows a few commonly used projections.

Let’s have a look at the CRS of our `sf` object.

``` r
st_crs(greensp_sf)
```

{% capture reveal %}

    ## Coordinate Reference System:
    ##   User input: EPSG:4326
    ##   wkt:
    ## GEOGCRS["WGS 84",
    ##     DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
    ##         ELLIPSOID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
    ##             LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
    ##     PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
    ##         ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    ##     CS[ellipsoidal,2],
    ##         AXIS["geodetic latitude (Lat)",north,
    ##             ORDER[1],
    ##             ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    ##         AXIS["geodetic longitude (Lon)",east,
    ##             ORDER[2],
    ##             ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    ##     USAGE[
    ##         SCOPE["unknown"],
    ##         AREA["World"],
    ##         BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],
    ##     ID["EPSG",4326]]

{% endcapture %}
{% include reveal.html button="View output of st_crs()" content=reveal %}

**Don’t be scared by that output!** You don’t need to understand every
line to proceed, but some bits are useful. This is called a WKT
(well-known text) string, and is one of the methods for describing CRSs.
This `sf` has a geographic CRS - WGS84 (World Geodetic System 84). It is
the most commonly used geographic CRS as is used by the Global
Positioning System (GPS). Let’s look at some of the elements.

-   `GEOGCRS["WGS 84" ...]` tells us the type of CRS (geographic) and
    its name.
-   `DATUM` - the underlying model of the Earth’s surface, in this case
    an ellipsoid.
-   `CS` - coordinate system. It has two axes, geographic latitude and
    longitude.

The output also gives us the **ESPG** number of WGS84, which is 4326.
The ESPG database contains many CRSs and the ESPG number can be used to
refer to a CRS when working with the sf library. **Details about
different CRSs, including their ESPG number, can be looked up on this
website: <https://epsg.io/>**

A lot of spatial operations are done on projected coordinates, and 2D
maps of the Earth are by definition projections. For working in a small
area of the world, a projected CRS optimised for accuracy for that
region would be best. It is also necessary to transform all datasets to
the same CRS if they come from different sources.

For example, The **British National Grid** CRS is very commonly used in
Britain. [The Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) and
many other organisations provide geographic data in this format.

Let’s transform our data into the British National Grid CRS, using it’s
[ESPG number (27700)](https://epsg.io/27700):

``` r
greensp_sf <- st_transform(greensp_sf, 27700)
```

Let’s view the resulting CRS:

``` r
# View the CRS
st_crs(greensp_sf)
```

The description has changed. Some key elements:

-   `PROJCRS["OSGB 1936 / British National Grid"` tells us we now have a
    Projected CRS, and its name.
-   `BASEGEOGCRS` - as already mentioned, all projected CRSs are based
    on a geographic CRS. This system is different from WGS84: it has a
    different ellipsoidal model (`DATUM`) of the Earth’s surface, which
    is more accurate for the UK.
-   `CONVERSION` - describes how georgaphic coordinates are converted to
    projected coordinates. This is a “Transverse Mercator” projection,
    which is relatively accurate around a central meridian, but gets
    worse the further east/west you go. Thus, both the datum and the
    projection are optimised for the UK.
-   `CS` - the axis in this CRS are eastings and northings, and the unit
    is the metre.

## 4. Spatial operations

#### Calculate area

Calculating the area of polygon or multipolygon geometries is done using
the `st_area()` function:

``` r
# Create and calculate a new column for feature area
greensp_sf <- mutate(greensp_sf, area = st_area(greensp_sf))
```

Let’s check out the result:

``` r
# Look at result
head(greensp_sf$area)
```

    ## Units: [m^2]
    ## [1]  29515.82  29073.37 150754.53 477437.67 398419.52 233094.05


The function has recognised that the coordinate system units in
our data are metres, and has returned `area` as a variable of type
`units`. Using the **units** library, we can easily convert between
measurement units without worrying by how much we need to
multiply/divide.

For our purposes, converting to hectares would be more convenient. We
can to that using the `set_units()` function:

``` r
# Convert area to to hectares
greensp_sf <- greensp_sf %>%
  mutate(area_ha = set_units(area, "ha")) %>%
  select(-area) # drop area column
```


Let’s view the resulting `sf` object interactively. A useful library is
**mapview**, which creates an interactive map with the features, with a
popup that shows all of the attributes upon clicking on the feature..

``` r
# View interactively
mapview(greensp_sf)
```

<br /> We notice that parks are sometimes overlapped by golf courses or
nature reserves. We also notice that some of the green spaces are quite
small. Let’s say we want to only keep green spaces that are at least 2
ha.

``` r
# Remove green spaces with <2 ha
greensp_sf <- filter(greensp_sf, as.numeric(area_ha) >= 2)
```


Now, let’s split the `sf` into multiple `sf` organised by green space
type. This will allows us to easily perform spatial operations between
the different types of green space.

``` r
# Separate into a list of multiple sf grouped by type
greensp_sf_list <- greensp_sf %>% split(.$greensp_type)

# Each sf object in the list can be accessed using the $ operator.
# E.g. greensp_sf_list$nature_reserve to get the sf object
# containing only nature reserves.
```


#### Remove overlap

Let’s say we would like to “cut out” the parts of parks that are covered
by golf courses or nature reserves. We need to modify the “park” `sf`
object in our list.

The `st_difference(x, y)` function will erase the parts of one `sf`
object (`x`) that are overlapped by another (`y`). However, to avoid the
function comparing each feature in `x` to each feature in `y`, we can
merge all features in the second `sf` into one single multipolygon
feature using `st_union()`.

``` r
# Remove the parts of parks where they are overlapped by nature reserves
greensp_sf_list$park <- st_difference(greensp_sf_list$park,
                                      st_union(greensp_sf_list$nature_reserve))

# Remove the parts of parks where they are overlapped by golf courses
greensp_sf_list$park <- st_difference(greensp_sf_list$park,
                                      st_union(greensp_sf_list$golf_course))
```


These are only two examples of many possible spatial operations. The [sf
cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf)
nicely summarises many of the possible operations.

We can now merge the list back into one `sf` object. Remember that we
changed the features, so we need to calculate area again!

``` r
# Let's turn the list back into one sf object. We will also need to re-calculate area!
greensp_sf <- bind_rows(greensp_sf_list) %>%
  # bind the list into one sf object
  mutate(area_ha = set_units(st_area(.), "ha")) %>%
  # calculate area again
  filter(as.numeric(area_ha) >= 2) # remove area < 2 ha again
```
<br />

## 5. Draw maps

It is now time to draw our maps. First, let’s reorder the types of green
spaces in a preferred way, remove underscores and capitalise.

``` r
# Reorder greenspace types, capitalise, remove underscores
greensp_sf_forplot <-
  mutate(greensp_sf,
         greensp_type = factor(greensp_type,
                               levels = c("park", "nature_reserve", "golf_course"),
                               labels = c("Park", "Nature reserve", "Golf course")))
```


#### Static map with ggplot2 (and ggmap, ggspatial)

We will use the **ggmap** library to download a raster background for
our map. [Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/) provide a clean
map without too many colours or labels. Always remember to check for
license and attribution required! We’ll need to use the rectangular
bounding box we obtained at the beginning of the tutorial to download
the raster.

``` r
# Download Stamen map raster for Edinburgh using ggmap
stamen_raster <- get_stamenmap(city_rect, zoom = 12)
```


We can now plot using **ggplot2**:

``` r
# Plot map with ggplot
(edi_greenspaces_map <-
  ggplot(data = greensp_sf_forplot) +
    inset_ggmap(stamen_raster) + # add ggmap background
    geom_sf(aes(fill = greensp_type)) + # add sf shapes, coloured by greensp_type
    coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326), expand = FALSE) +
    # change the CRS of the sf back to WGS84 to match the ggmap raster
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#44AA99", "#117733", "#AA4499")) +
    # add custom colours from Tol palette (colourblind-friendly)
    labs(title = "Green spaces in Edinburgh, Scotland",
         subtitle = "Parks, nature reserves and golf courses > 2 ha\n",
         caption = paste0("Map tiles by Stamen Design (stamen.com), CC BY 3.0. ",
                         "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0\n",
                         "Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL. ",
                         "http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright")) +
    # add various labels
    annotation_scale(location = "bl") + # ggspatial scale on bottom left
    annotation_north_arrow(location = "tr") + # ggspatial arrow on top right
    theme_void() + # get rid of axis ticks, titles
    theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
          legend.position = c(.98, .02),
          legend.justification = c("right", "bottom"),
          legend.box.just = "right",
          legend.box.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "gray"),
          legend.margin = margin(6, 6, 6, 6),
          # move legend to bottom right and customise
          plot.margin = margin(12,12,12,12))
          # add margin around plot
)
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tutorials/spatial-vector-sf/ggplot_map-1.png)


This plot can be saved as a file using `ggsave()`:

``` r
ggsave("output-maps/edi_greenspaces_map.png", edi_greenspaces_map, width = 8, height = 6.5)
```


#### Interactive map with **tmap**

The **tmap** library allows us to easily create interactive maps using a
ggplot-like syntax.

``` r
# Plot interactively with tmap
tmap_mode("view") # interactive mode

(edi_greenspace_tmap <-
  tm_basemap("Stamen.Terrain") + # add Stamen Terrain basemap
  tm_shape(greensp_sf_forplot) + # add the sf
  tm_sf(col = "greensp_type", # colour by green space type
        title = "", # no legend title
        palette = c("#44AA99", "#117733", "#AA4499"), # custom fill colours
        popup.vars = c("Area  " = "area_ha"), # customise popup to show area
        popup.format = list(digits=1)) + # limit area to 1 decimal digit
  tm_scale_bar() # add scale bar
)
```


This should produce the same interactive map as the one you saw in the beginning of the tutorial (it will appear in the Viewer tab in RStudio). To save the tmap as a .html file:

``` r
tmap_save(tm = edi_greenspace_tmap, filename = "output-maps/edi_greenspace_tmap.html")
```

## 6. Challenge

Calculate the total area of each type of green space. Please note that
we can’t just sum the areas we calculated as there are overlapping
polygons within the green space types.

{% capture reveal %}

To solve the issue of overlap within the green space types, We can use
`st_union()` on each `sf` in the list to merge all of them into one
multipolygon. Then, we can calculate their area using `st_area()` and
finally use `st_units()` to convert to hectares.

``` r
(greensp_type_area <-
  lapply(greensp_sf_list,
      function(x) set_units(st_area(st_union(x)), "ha")) %>% # apply the function to each element of the list using lapply()
  as.data.frame() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "greensp_type",
               values_to = "area_ha"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   greensp_type     area_ha
    ##   <chr>               [ha]
    ## 1 golf_course     975.6855
    ## 2 nature_reserve  289.6554
    ## 3 park           1389.1306

## Notes
-   Remember that we only extracted three categories of “leisure” form
    OpenStreetMap for simplicity. There are some other types of green
    spaces not included in the tutorial. You can practice your skills by
    expanding the OSM query to include them and then add them to the
    spatial operations and visualizations.
